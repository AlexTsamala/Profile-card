- Live Site URL: [Move elements](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- hr
- trasnform:translate
- box-sizing: border-box;
- background-picture

### What I learned

It was another productive project for me. I learned how to manage divs and construct them easly , i learned how to add multiple background images at the same time and how to rotate them.

```html
<hr class="some html code i am proud of" />
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css-code
background-image: url(link-of-picture),
    url(link-of-picture);
  background-position: bottom 40vh right 50vw, left 48vw top 50vh;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

Now i want to focus on Html Css and Js and want to know almost everything about this languages and then i am planning to learn framewrok like react or angular and also back-end development.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to learn syntax. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Html css flex-box. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
